# ACI Chart Learning Tool Blueprint

## Overview

This application is designed to be an interactive learning tool for understanding the ACI (Automated Charting and Information) chart. It will provide a visual representation of the chart and detailed explanations of its components.

## Project Outline

### Structure

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `style.css`: For all the styling of the application.
*   `main.js`: The main JavaScript file for application logic and web components.
*   `blueprint.md`: This file, outlining the project.

### Design and Features

*   **Modern and Clean UI:** The application will have a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
*   **Interactive Chart:** A chart will be displayed, and users can interact with it to learn about its different parts.
*   **Web Components:** The application will be built using Web Components for a modular and maintainable structure.
    *   `<chart-container>`: A component to encapsulate the chart itself.
    *   `<info-panel>`: A component to display information about the selected chart element.
*   **Three.js for Charting:** The chart will be rendered using the Three.js library to allow for future enhancements and 3D visualizations.

## Current Plan

1.  **Create the basic HTML structure.**
2.  **Add initial styling for a clean layout.**
3.  **Set up the main JavaScript file and include the Three.js library.**
4.  **Create the `<chart-container>` and `<info-panel>` web components.**
5.  **Render a basic chart using Three.js.**
6.  **Populate the info panel with initial content.**
7.  **Add interactivity to connect the chart and the info panel.**
